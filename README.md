# SpamBot
A simple, yet powerful spam bot coded in python. We are not responsible if you lose any friends ;)

To use this spam bot, open the application or run the python code. The application will then prompt you for: 
- Message to Spam
- Number of Messages (Maximum 10,000)
- Delay time between each message (Maximum 100 seconds)

Once you have filled out the information, press 'DONE' in the bottom right corner of the application.
Then, select a textbox with your cursor (Whatsapp, Discord, Messages, etc.)
Spamming will start promptly 10 seconds after you have pressed 'DONE'
To exit spamming, move your cursor to the top left corner of your computer/laptop to enable the failsafe and kill the program. 
To spam a paragraph, such as a song or script, copy and paste your paragraph into the textbox. The spammer will then function as usual, but will instead spam each line of your paragraph separately.
